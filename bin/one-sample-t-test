# This is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis that the expected value (mean) of a sample of independent observations a is equal to the 
# given population mean.
#
# (http://benalexkeen.com/comparative-statistics-in-python-using-scipy/)
# If p-value iis far less than the standard thresholds of 0.05 or 0.01, then we reject the null hypothesis and we can say 
# there is a statistically significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean
#

#
#
# It goes on to say that scipy always gives the test statistic as signed.
# This means that given p and t values from a two-tailed test,
# you would reject the null hypothesis of a greater-than test when p/2 < alpha and t > 0, and of a less-than test when p/2 < alpha and t < 0
