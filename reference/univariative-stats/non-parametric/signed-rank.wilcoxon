# The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test used when comparing two related sam-
# ples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks
# differ (i.e. it is a paired difference test). It is equivalent to one-sample test of the difference of paired samples.
# It can be used as an alternative to the paired Studentâ€™s t-test, t-test for matched pairs, or the t-test for dependent
# samples when the population cannot be assumed to be normally distributed.
#
#   H0: No statistically significant difference between population mean ranks.
#   H1: There is statistically significant difference
