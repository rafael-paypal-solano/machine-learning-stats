# Elasticity, Example 13.1 in Mathematical Statistics 7th Ed. #

The coded values for a measure of elasticity in plastic prepared by two different processes are given in Table 13.1. Independent samples,both of size 6, were taken from the output of each process. Do the data present sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in mean elasticity for the two processes?
