# Bonding Agent, Exercise 13.49 in Mathematical Statistics 7th Ed. #

An evaluation of diffusion bonding of zircaloy components is performed. The main objective is to determine which of three elements—nickel, iron, or copper—is the best bonding agent. A series of zircaloy components are bonded using each of the possible bonding agents. Due to significant variation in components machined from different ingots, a randomized block design is used, blocking on the ingots. Two components from each ingot are bonded together using each of the three agents, and the pressure (in units of 1000 pounds per square inch) required to separate the bonded components is measured. The data shown in the following table are obtained. Is there evidence of a difference in mean pressures required to separate the components among the three bonding agents? Use α = .05.
