    No Python hacks in this implementation. Also, this accepts many levels of nested lists.
    The limit is in the number of recursive calls.
    @alist: A tuple or list.
    @return: A flat list with all elements of @alist and its nested lists.
    Complexity: `Î˜(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements of @alist
    plus the number of elements of all nested lists.
